# Summary
A mobile app that uses AI to evaluate the nutritional quality and environmental impact of food products. Shoppers can scan barcodes to receive a health score out of 100, a summary of nutritional pros and cons, and a traffic-light indicator for food mileage. The goal: empower consumers to make informed, sustainable dietary choices.
